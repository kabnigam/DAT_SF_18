Anyways my name is Kabir Nigam. I was born in Boston and moved to San Diego when I was 9. Music has always been a passion of mine. I have played guitar for about 12 years and have been producing my own music on the computer for 5. 

I studied Neuroscience at UCLA because I was interested in answering the simple but complex question of "Why do certain people like certain types of music?" I had high hopes of being able to isolate neuronal responses to different types of music using fMRI technology. This sparked a greater interest in human perception which developed into a passion for the human psyche. 

I went onto study Experimental Neuroscience at Imperial College London as a Master's student and had the most influential research experience of my life. During my time, I had the extermely unique opportunity to be the data analyst for one of the only Phase 2 clincal trials investigating the use of Psilocybin as an intervention for treatment-resistant depression (magic mushrooms). As someone who has seen the flaws in the current status of psychiatric treatment, being part of this study gave me hope for the future of mental health treatment (i.e. PPsilocybin worked pretty well for patients that have not responded to 5 or (most often) more psychiatric medications).

I then went to medical school and quickly realized that this might not be the path for me, a, which brings me to now:. I see data as the future of medicine annd regardless of wheter I go back to medical school or not, I know that these skills will be useful in improving the current status of medicine.
